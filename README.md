# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This app was build as part of a Lighthouse Labs project. The goal of the project and app were to tease out functional and style challenges using CSS, HTML and jquery. 

## Getting Started

1. [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) a new repository using this repository as a template.
2. Clone your repository onto your local device.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Functionality

- Select write a new tweet in the navigation or go straight to the new tweet section
- Once submitted, you will see your tweet at the top of the other tweets
- Scroll through tweets, select the top button if you want to navigate back to top
- Pin, retweet and like do not have any functionality - they were added stylistically only. 

## Dependencies

- Express
- Node 5.10.x or above
- md5: ^2.1.0
